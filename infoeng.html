        <h2>Program description</h2>
        <h2>1. The program is designed to calculate the exposure time based on the already available data on the successful illumination.</h2>
         <h2>   
        2. The logic of dependences of exposure time on radiation thickness and focal length is taken as a basis. In this case, the direct dependence of the exposure time on the change in the radiation thickness and the quadratic dependence on the change in the focal length are accepted.</h2>
        <h2>3. This program is suitable for cases when non-destructive testing is performed on the same alloy using the same film.
</h2> 
            <h2>4. Application example: the gleam of part No. 1 made of 09G2S steel was carried out using AGFA F8 film. The exposure time was selected empirically. In a situation where part No. 2 will consist of the same steel, but will have different characteristics (different radiation thickness), and the clearance will occur on the AGFA F8 film, then the application of the program can be called permissible.</h2>
        <h2>5. Radiation thickness is the amount of steel material in millimeters between the film and the radiation source. Therefore, if we consider a pipe with a diameter of 219 mm and a thickness of 4 mm, then with a clearance through 2 walls, the radiation thickness will be 8 mm.</h2>
